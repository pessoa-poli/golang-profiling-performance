# Go performance tunning

This experiment was done as a way to study Dave Cheney's profiling talk which can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nok0aYiGiYA)

The repo which holds Dave's package for one line profiling, used during the presentation, can be found here: https://github.com/pkg/profile

The original page where I found the mobydick text can be found [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/old/moby10b.txt)

The changes made from file to file are commented, and should be easy to follow.
